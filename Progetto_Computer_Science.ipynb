       " ('Rocky is an adorable yorkie mix who is 4-1/2 years old and weighs 12-1/2 lbs. He and his brother Buddy are bonded and must be adopted together. Their adoption fee is $675. They are being fostered in Dunedin, FL.\\n\\nUPDATED BIO 08/17/2019: Rocky and Buddy arrived in UYR several days ago in just a nick of time. Their previous owner passed away suddenly and family was unable to care for them. Rocky and Buddy did not have the best life in their former home and were kept outside in a hot metal storage shed in the hot summer sun of Florida, along with two other small dogs who have also been rescued by UYR.\\n\\nThese two handsome boys are litter mates, and bonded for life and will need to be adopted together. Even though they are fairly young, they have a sweet and mellow personality. Since arriving in their foster home, we have learned that they are excellent travelers in a car using their harnesses and safety leashes. They get in the car and lay down without so much as a peep out of them. Their laid-back demeanors shine through when getting their baths a well. They are getting along with the other dogs in the foster home, and they just want to lay close to their humans. They arenâ\\x80\\x99t too sure about the cat though and bark when they see her. They may have never seen a kitty before, and that may change in time. \\n\\nRocky and Buddy have already seen the vet. They were perfect little patients at the clinic, not showing even a hint of aggression, and they appear to be very healthy. Thankfully both of them were heartworm negative and are very healthy. Their foster parents are just starting to work on house-training, and with frequent outings, they should respond well. The former owners never leash-trained these sweet boys, but they are starting to get the hang of it. Rocky and Buddy are so well-behaved and with their friendly and engaging personalities, they will make a wonderful addition to the right family.',\n",
       "  'Buddy is an adorable yorkie mix who is 4-1/2 years old and weighs 15 lbs. He and his brother Rocky are bonded and must be adopted together. Their adoption fee is $675. They are being fostered in Dunedin, FL.\\n\\nUPDATED BIO 08/17/2019: Buddy and Rocky arrived in UYR several days ago in just a nick of time. Their previous owner passed away suddenly and family was unable to care for them. Buddy & Rocky did not have the best life in their former home and were kept outside in a hot metal storage shed in the hot summer sun of Florida, along with two other small dogs who have also been rescued by UYR.\\n\\nThese two handsome boys are litter mates, and bonded for life and will need to be adopted together. Even though they are fairly young, they have a sweet and mellow personality. Since arriving in their foster home, we have learned that they are excellent travelers in a car using their harnesses and safety leashes. They get in the car and lay down without so much as a peep out of them. Their laid-back demeanors shine through when getting their baths a well. They are getting along with the other dogs in the foster home, and they just want to lay close to their humans. They arenâ\\x80\\x99t too sure about the cat though and bark when they see her. They may have never seen a kitty before, and that may change in time. \\n\\nBuddy and Rocky have already seen the vet. They were perfect little patients at the clinic, not showing even a hint of aggression, and they appear to be very healthy. Thankfully both of them were heartworm negative and are very healthy. Their foster parents are just starting to work on house-training, and with frequent outings, they should respond well. The former owners never leash-trained these sweet boys, but they are starting to get the hang of it. Buddy and Rocky are so well-behaved and with their friendly and engaging personalities, they will make a wonderful addition to the right family.',\n",

       " (\"Oscar was rescued with his little Buddy, Felix.  They came from a North GA shelter as part of a hoarding case.  Oscar is extremely timid and takes a while to warm up to you, and even then, he only lets you pet under his chin, sometimes you can scratch behind his ears, but he runs away if you raise your hand to pet his head or back.  We have been unable to catch him except to throw a treat in a crate.  He will jump on your legs for a treat and follow you around all day.  He likes the company of all dogs and is very playful, especially with his friend, Felix.  For this reason, they should be adopted together.  Felix gives him courage to approach you upon first meeting. Oscar is going to take some work, and needs a patient and understanding rescue-minded, dog-experienced adopter.  Even though his foster mom can't pick him up yet to hug him and snuggle with him, he has wormed his way into her heart, and she looks forward to giving him the little bit of affection he allows. When he finally comes out of his shell, someone is going to have a wonderful little dog.\\n\\nAlcovy dogs are spayed/neutered, up to date on all vaccines, up to date on heart-worm preventative and flea preventative and micro-chipped.
